1. Download ASL sources: git clone https://github.com/Scorpio92/ASL.git -b "branch name"

2. Patch "build" directory from ASL downloaded dir. See commit â„–2. Dirs: external, system - not necessarily patch.

3. Path kernel sources. Prepare kernel_defconfig, include this:

   PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += \
   $(LOCAL_PATH)/asl/ramdisk/init.rc:root/init.rc \

6. Setup BoardConfig, add:

   TARGET_PROVIDES_INIT_RC := true     

   TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE := kernel   

   TARGET_KERNEL_CONFIG := kernel_defconfig

7. make your ROM
